# AWS Cloud SOC Detection Engineering Lab

This lab simulates a real-world AWS Security Operations Center (SOC) use case where various cloud activities are monitored and analyzed for threats. The project focuses on building and testing detection rules for misconfigurations, suspicious login behavior, privilege escalation, and API abuse using native AWS logs.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Services:
- AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty
- IAM, S3, EC2, Lambda
- Splunk (optional) for centralized log analysis
- Python for automation/scripts

üéØ Key Objectives:
- Simulate attack scenarios in AWS
- Monitor logs and alerts in near real-time
- Build detection logic for common threat patterns
- Improve SOC visibility and incident response in cloud

üì¶ Outcome:
A hands-on detection engineering lab that sharpens your cloud security monitoring skills, with clear mappings to MITRE ATT&CK for cloud.
